FABSCRAP
Site Re-design
<!-- image of the home page here -->

CONTEXT
FABSCRAP provides textile recycling services for fashion industry companies in New York City. To attract its clients, the website must convey that FABSCRAP is an expert on fashion and sustainability and will bring value to any fashion company's brand, while at the same time not visually compete with any clients' branding.

PROCESS
I conducted an interview to learn about FABSCRAP's service and determine requirements, as well as to understand content and design needs. I then created of a site map, wireframes, and style boards.

TATTOO STUDIO
Site Re-design

CONTEXT
The original site content was poorly organized and laid out. Its palette and appearance was harsh and amateur, and did not match the tattoo studio's self-description as "knowledgeable", "friendly", and "professional".

ORIGINAL SITE

PROCESS
I conducted a site analysis, produced a style board, and designed two versions of a high-fidelity mockup. The first version improved the page's layout while conveying a friendly, beachy place of business, but was critiqued as being generic.

MOCKUP

RESULT
Based on feedback from the first mockup, my final design had a more dramatic, artistic appearance, showcasing images of tattoos, more artistic typography, and an inkier palette.

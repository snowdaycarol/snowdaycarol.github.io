WYCK HOUSE
Site Re-Design

CONTEXT
Wyck is a historic house and garden in Philadelphia that today provides cultural preservation and interpretation of a National Historic Landmark. The website features the organization’s history and its many programs and resources.

ORIGINAL SITE

PROCESS
Wyck originally asked for help changing their site’s WordPress template, but through our interview and site analysis we saw the site was a bit unorganized, the written content was dry and dense, and important events and programs were insufficiently showcased.

WIREFRAME

PROTOTYPE
Prototypes were created in Adobe XD

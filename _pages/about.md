User Experience Designer with previous lives in industrial design and art history, pottery, restaurants, and event management. More recently I completed a Web Design Certificate from University of the Arts, and now work at a healthcare IT company.

I try to be thoughtfully creative in my work, enjoy being part of a team, and want to use my skills to help other people.

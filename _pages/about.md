User Experience Designer with degrees in industrial design and art history. I see design as a process of meeting needs. In previous lives I made pottery, waited tables, and managed events. More recently I completed a Web Design Certificate from [University of the Arts](https://www.uarts.edu). I now work at a [healthcare IT company](https://www.cerner.com) where I continue to refine my skills, while learning new ones.

I try to be thoughtfully creative in my work, enjoy being part of a team, and want to use my skills to help other people.

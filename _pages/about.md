User Experience Designer with degrees in industrial design and art history. I see design as a process of meeting needs.

In previous lives I made pottery, waited tables, and managed events. More recently I completed a Web Design Certificate from [University of the Arts](https://www.uarts.edu).

I now work at [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com), a healthcare IT company where I collaborate with development teams on healthcare revenue cycle applications. I continue to refine my skills, while learning new ones.

I try to be thoughtfully creative in my work, enjoy being part of a team, and want to use my skills to help other people.
